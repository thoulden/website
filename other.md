## ModernPDF (Present+Hover Functionality)

I've been very happily using [Kevin Bryan's ModernPDF](https://github.com/kevincure/ModernPDF) for better browser PDF functionality. For me this was going to work better with a presentation option and internal link hover view (eg. hovering over 'See Equation (38)' gives you a small window to view that equation in the text). So I [made my own with this extra functionality](https://github.com/thoulden/ModernPDF_withhoverview).

## Manhattan Runs

I moved to New York in September 2025 and I got the idea to run every street in Manhattan. [I built this website to track my progress.](https://runs.thomas-houlden.com)
See [GitHub](https://github.com/thoulden/manhattan-map) for replication.
