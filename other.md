## Manhattan Runs

So I moved to New York in September 2025 and I got the idea to run every street in Manhattan. I don’t really know how far that is (ChatGPT suggested around 800 miles), but I am thinking it looks short enough to try and do in a year. So that’s my goal: run every street in Manhattan in the next 12 months. [Claude and I built this website to track my progress.](https://runs.thomas-houlden.com)
